### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for the application. There will be two pages, one for login and one that shows old ratings and where you can create new ratings. 
- **CSS** - Styling that uses fun colors that indicate the ratings. 
- **React** - Provides login, rating input display, inputing ratins, display other users ratings, and use of React for routing and components. 
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for: login, retrieving old reviews, and submitting new reviews.
- **DB/Login** - Store users, ratings and TV shows in database. Register and login users. Credentials will be securely stored in the database and also old ratings. You can't comment on other ratings unless authenticated. 
- **WebSocket** - As each person rate shows, the ratings are broadcasted to all their friends.
